s = babad
i = 0, longest = "", new = b
longest = "b"
i = 1, longest ="b", new = a
can't add it, longest doesn't change
i = 2, longest = "b", new = bab
longest = "bab"
i = 3, longest = "bab", new = a
can't add it
i = 4, longest = "bab", new = d
can't add it

then we move the left pointer.

for each entry in table,
  check if adding all remaining letters to the last valid palindrome works
